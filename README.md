# Treatment-of-Dye-Effluent-with-teak-leaves-and-banana-trunk
The present work investigates the removal of synthetic dyes from aqueous solutions
with the help of activated carbon prepared by chemical activation of waste leaves and banana
trunk. With the rapid development of industrialization and globalization in recent years, more
quantity of textile dye wastewater has been discharged into the environment. Now a days
technology of wastewater treatment has difficulty in meeting all the practical requirements of
harmless wastewater discharge and therefore, the exploration and development of new
technologies to treat various types of waste water are vitally needed. The main objective of the
work is to prepare an activated adsorbent from waste leaves and banana trunk for removing the
color from effluent. To evaluate the efficiency of the activated waste leaves and banana trunk,
column adsorption technique is selected in the removal of synthetic dye. Finally, the challenges
and prospects of wastewater treatment are summarized.

Key words: Decolorization, Dyes, wastewater, Scavengers, Activated carbon, Chemical
